## ðŸ”– About the project:

> The project is a web interface that shows Star Wars metrics statistics and statistics based on the https://swapi.dev/

## How to web interface works:

When running the project you will be redirected to the main page. On this project you can search some metrics as: 
â€¢ how many people?
â€¢ how many planets?
â€¢ how many starships?
â€¢ how many vehicles?
â€¢ how many filmes?
â€¢ 5 most popular vehicles? (counting how many people have them)
â€¢ 5 most popular starships? (counting how many people have them)
â€¢ 5 most popular characters? (counting how many times appeared on a film)
â€¢ 5 most planets characters? (counting how many times appeared on a film)

To search for metrics just type, for example planets/1. With this entry we will search for planet number 1
